# FCND Part 4: Estimation (CPP)

### Notes on Notebook README-s

1. The individual sections have TOCs in their own README.md files.
2. The notebooks, both exercises and provided solutions, are saved from the website workspace. To view and access the directory the currently open and running notebook exists in, click **File->Open...**. The directory will open in a new browser tab and show all the materials for the current section.
3. All the notebooks can be downloaded from **File->Download as**.
4. Note with notebooks, even if there are not cell content changes, a change in the metadata causes all the notebook's contents to be _treated as new additions_.
